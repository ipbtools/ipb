# Verification Notes

Host:

- macOS 27 beta
- Xcode 27.0.0 Beta 2
- DeviceHub 27.0 build 244.2.3
- DeviceKit 244.2.0
- CoreDevice/CoreDeviceUtilities 636.3.0

Device:

- iPhone 13 Pro
- iOS 27.0
- Device identifier used during extraction: `<device-uuid>`

Commands verified:

```sh
bin/devicehubctl tap 0.5 0.5
bin/devicehubctl long 0.615 0.675 1.2
bin/devicehubctl scroll 0.5 0.75 0 0.30
bin/devicehubctl swipe 0.5 0.75 0.5 0.35
bin/devicehubctl home
bin/devicehubctl recents
bin/devicehubctl screenshot build/smoke.png
bin/devicehubctl service-ids
```

The original investigation also captured screenshots after each command, but those are intentionally not committed to keep the repository small and reviewable.

Additional protocol probe commands now exposed:

```sh
bin/devicehubctl services
bin/devicehubctl reset-gesture 0x101
bin/devicehubctl button 0x0c 0x40
bin/devicehubctl uhid-report 0x101 0.5 0.5 0 0
bin/devicehubctl digitizer-event 0.5 0.5 0 0 1 2 0
```

`services` currently reaches the UniversalHID Mercury peer but does not yet decode `connectedServices` successfully; this is tracked in `docs/protocol.md`.

After correcting the Mercury `sendSync(value:)` generic argument order, the `services` probe no longer hits the previous illegal-instruction crash path. A later guard also prevents the raw Mercury sync probe from trying to bridge a zero-word reply into `NSDictionary`. The remaining result is a remote-level `Connection invalid`, which matches the current hypothesis that DeviceHub uses the async `UniversalHIDService.connectedServiceDescriptors()` path for dynamic descriptor discovery rather than the synchronous typed Mercury path currently exposed by the CLI.

Current probe output:

```text
connected services request: UniversalHIDServiceDDIPayload.Request {connectedServices}
remote event: { "XPCErrorDescription" => "Connection invalid" }
connected services result=1 raw=0000000000000000
```

The experimental `services-async` command was removed from the public wrapper after disassembly showed that the crash was caused by a local ABI mismatch when calling Mercury's generic `send(value:replyQueue:replyHandler:)` overload. The original DeviceHub path should be re-entered through a Swift async CoreDevice shim, not by exposing that unsafe assembly call.

`service-ids` is host-side and does not require an active device socket. It is verified to return `mainTouchscreen = 0x101`, and that resolved value has been used successfully with:

```sh
service_id=$(bin/devicehubctl service-ids | awk '/^mainTouchscreen/ {print $2}')
UHID_SERVICE_ID="$service_id" bin/devicehubctl uhid-report "$service_id" 0.5 0.5 0 0
UHID_SERVICE_ID="$service_id" bin/devicehubctl reset-gesture
```

DeviceHub / DeviceKit checks performed:

```sh
plutil -p /Applications/Xcode-27.0.0-Beta.2.app/Contents/Applications/DeviceHub.app/Contents/Info.plist
otool -L /Applications/Xcode-27.0.0-Beta.2.app/Contents/Applications/DeviceHub.app/Contents/MacOS/DeviceHub
otool -L /Applications/Xcode-27.0.0-Beta.2.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DeviceKit.framework/Versions/A/DeviceKit
strings -a -t x /Applications/Xcode-27.0.0-Beta.2.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DeviceKit.framework/Versions/A/DeviceKit | rg 'HIDManager|connectedService|createService|fetchConnectedServiceDescriptors'
nm -gU /Library/Developer/PrivateFrameworks/CoreDevice.framework/Versions/A/CoreDevice | xcrun swift-demangle | rg 'UniversalHIDService|connectedService|createService'
nm -gU /Library/Developer/PrivateFrameworks/CoreDeviceUtilities.framework/Versions/A/CoreDeviceUtilities | xcrun swift-demangle | rg 'DDIUniversalHIDServicePayload|HIDServiceDescriptor|HIDServiceID'
```

Findings:

- `DeviceHub` links `DeviceKit`, but the HID manager implementation is in `DeviceKit.framework`.
- `DeviceKit` links `CoreDevice`, `CoreDeviceUtilities`, `UniversalHID`, `HID.framework`, and weakly `UniversalHIDKit`.
- `DeviceKit.HIDManager` has strings and code paths for `fetchConnectedServiceDescriptors(generation:)`, `createService(descriptor:)`, `reset(serviceID:)`, `report(reportID:)`, and local service lookup by `serviceID`.
- `CoreDevice.UniversalHIDService` exposes synchronous report sending/reset/barrier and async descriptor/service discovery.
- `CoreDeviceUtilities.DDIUniversalHIDServicePayload.ConnectedServices` wraps `[CoreDevice.HIDServiceDescriptor]`.
